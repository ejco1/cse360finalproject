CSE 360 Final Project
Authors: Hunter Carmona, Jordan Slater, Ethan Co

In order to compile this project, the user will need to download JFreeChart and add it to their class path. Instructions on how to do so can be found here https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jfreechart/jfreechart_installation.htm

Once the two JFreeChart jar files are downloaded and added to the classpath, the user can compile the project from class Menu.
The program has two menu items, file and about.

The about tab has a button titled "About", when pressed a popup will appear with the project information and authors.
The menu tab has four buttons, "Load a roster", "Add attendance", "Save", and "Plot data"

The load a roster button when pressed will open a file chooser in which the user will select a csv file to be used for the table. Once a file is chosen, the data will be loaded onto a JTable.

The add attendance button when pressed will open a file chooser in which the user will select a csv file to be used to add attendance to the students on the table

The save button will write the data on the table to a csv file in the user specified path

The plot data button will plot the attendance data of the students on a scatter plot
